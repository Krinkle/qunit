## Changelog

* Assert: Introduce Assert constructor with test context. This heavily improves debugging of async tests, as assertions can't leak into other tests anymore. Use the new `assert` argument in your test to get the full benefit of this. (Leo Balter) [#374](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/374)
* Assert: Improve the default message from `assert.ok()`  to include the exact received value.
* Assert: Removal of deprecated `raises`, `same`, and `equals` methods. Use `throws`, `deepEqual`, and `equal` instead.
* Core: Add `totalTests` for total number of tests to `QUnit.begin()`  data.
* Dump: Rename `QUnit.jsDump` to `QUnit.dump`, the old name is kept as deprecated alias and may be removed later.
* Dump: Output non-enumerable properties of TypeError. Makes it easier to compare properties of error objects.
* HTML Reporter: Output only assertion count for green tests. Less visual clutter for passing tests.
* Assert: Support for buggy IE native Error types in `assert.throws()`.

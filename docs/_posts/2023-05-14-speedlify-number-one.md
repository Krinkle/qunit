Guess who's number 1 on the test-runners Speedlify, for the third year in a row!

One of the things that keeps [qunitjs.com](https://qunitjs.com) lean is our approach to search.

Rather than the popular JS-only Algolia DocSearch widget at ~100KB, we use a fast 2KB alternative based on HTML5, with progressive enhancement.

I recently published this as re-usable package: [typesense-minibar](https://github.com/jquery/typesense-minibar).

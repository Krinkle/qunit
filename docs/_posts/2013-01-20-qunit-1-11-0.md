## Changelog

### Added

* Addons: New "Ninja" theme.
* Assert: New [`assert.propEqual()`](https://qunitjs.com/api/assert/propEqual/) and `assert.notPropEqual()`. (Timo Tijhof) [#317](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/317)
* HTML Reporter: Capture and show each test's runtime duration. [#344](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/344)

### Changed

* Addons/Composite: Test suites can be named by including an object with name & path props within array param for `.testSuites()`.
* Addons/PhantomJS: Include source in assertion details.
* Core: Apply the same exception handling for test and teardown try/catch as for setup.

### Fixed

* Addons/Canvas: Use 0.6 as alpha value to avoid inconsistencies between browsers. [#342](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/342)
* Addons/JUnitLogger: Rewrite as it was in bad shape (unused vars, duplicate internal code, sub-optimal XmlWriter logic).
* Addons/PhantomJS: Removed the polling mechanism in favor of PhantomJS 1.6+'s `WebPage#onCallback`.
* Assert: Make `throws` ES3 compatible. (Mathias Bynens)
* Core: Fix URL generator to take protocol and host into account to fix usage with file protocol in IE7/8.
* Core: Fix issue with Error.prototype.toString in IE 7.
* Core: Improve start()-called-too-often fix, initialize semaphore at 1, fixes autostart=false case. Also provide stack for the offending start() call.
* Core: Push a failing assertion when calling start() while already running. Resets anyway to keep other tests going. [#314](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/314)
* Core: Remove global variable "assert". [#341](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/341)
* Core: There's type-free objects in Firefox, extend objectType() to allow null match. [#315](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/315)
* Dump: Extend jsdump to output Error objects as such, including the message property. Extend throws to provide 'expected' value when possible. [#307](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/307)
* Dump: Include contents of text nodes in `jsDump.node`. (Timo Tijhof) [#380](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/380)
* HTML Reporter: Delay start until `QUnit.init` happened. [#358](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/358)
* HTML Reporter: Change summary text to use the word "assertions" instead of "tests". [#336](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/336)

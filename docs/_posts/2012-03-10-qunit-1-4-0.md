## Changelog

* Core: A test without any assertions now fails by default, unless [`assert.expect(0)`](https://qunitjs.com/api/assert/expect/) is called. [#178](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/178)
* Core: Add `QUnit.pushFailure` to log error conditions like exceptions. Accepts stacktrace as second argument, allowing extraction with catched exceptions (useful even in Safari). [#210](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/210)
* Core: Apply [`notrycatch` option](http://localhost:4000/api/config/notrycatch/) to setup and teardown hooks. [#203](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/203) [#204](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/204)
* Core: Extend exports object with QUnit properties at the end of the file to export everything.
* Core: Prefix test-related session-storage items to make removal more specific. [#213](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/213)
* HTML Reporter: Sort objects in value dumps alphabetically to improve diffs. [#206](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/206)

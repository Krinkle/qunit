excerpt: New stacktrace cleaning, CLI file extensions, and various performance improvements and bug fixes.
---

FYI:
* âœ¨ There is a new [QUnit Blog](https://qunitjs.com/blog/).
  We're also on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@qunit) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/qunitjs.com).
* ðŸ“— There are [new Guides, Support, and Chat sections](https://qunitjs.com/intro/). <br>Including best practices and examples for async tests, callbacks, and event-based code.

### Added

* CLI: Add `.mjs` and `.cjs` to the default file extensions when reading a test directory.

  These have been monitored by watch mode since QUnit 2.18, but were not loaded or executed
  unless you passed them as individual files, or used your own glob like `test/*.{js,mjs,cjs}`.

  If you currently pass a directory to the QUnit CLI and have matching `.mjs` or `.cjs`
  files that should not be executed, you can opt-out by passing `test/*.js` or
  `test/**/*.js` explicitly instead of `test/`.
* CLI: Add stacktrace cleaning by omitting or greying out internal QUnit and Node.js frames in TAP reporter. [#1795](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/1795). [#1789](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/1789)

* Core: Add [`QUnit.config.reporters.tap`](https://qunitjs.com/api/config/reporters/) for enabling TAP via preconfig. [#1711](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/1711)
* Core: Add memory to the [`runEnd` event](https://qunitjs.com/api/callbacks/QUnit.on/#the-runend-event) to allow late listeners. This helps [browser integrations](https://qunitjs.com/browser/#integrations) that only relay a summary. [27a33d1593](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/commit/27a33d15938a601716a81a638882a16c1bd7f2b9)

### Fixed

* HTML Reporter: Fix unexpected pointer cursor on "Source:" label. [f8cce2bb06](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/commit/f8cce2bb06396561e0cdcbf58c4e83ddf7a1f27f)
* HTML Reporter: Faster "Hide passed" toggling on large test suites. [b13ade0fd7](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/commit/b13ade0fd7c3baf4d0e68abe04f7d1609f686877)

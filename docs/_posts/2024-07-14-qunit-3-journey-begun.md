The journey to QUnit 3 has begun!

Most projects require no changes to upgrade. It's the same easy-to-use API you know.

If you use/maintain plugins, themes, or other integrations, minor changes might be needed. Take QUnit 3.0.0-alpha for a spin, and let us know about any surprises or issues!

* Changelog: [3.0.0-alpha.4](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/blob/3.0.0-alpha.4/History.md)
* Much improved docs: [qunitjs.com/intro](https://qunitjs.com/intro/)
* New theme design: [PR #1774](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/1774)
* Chatroom: [#qunitjs_qunit:gitter.im on Matrix](https://qunitjs.com/intro/#chat)

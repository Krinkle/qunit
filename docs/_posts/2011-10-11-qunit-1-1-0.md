Improved error handling, and various bug fixes.

## Changelog

* Core: Check if setTimeout is available before trying to delay running the next task. [#160](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/160)
* Core: Default 'expected' to null in `asyncTest()`, same as in `test()`.
* Core: Avoid treating random objects with `length` properties as empty arrays in comparisons. (Trevor Parscal) [#164](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/164)
* Core: Fix IE 6-8 compat with comparisons of NodeList objects. (Trevor Parscal) [#166](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/166)
* Core: Fix a bug where after an async test, assertions could move between test cases because of internal state (config.current) being incorrectly set.
* Core: Handle `expect(0)` as expected, i.e. `expect(0); ok(true, foo);` will cause a test to fail. (Markus Messner-Chaney) [#158](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/158)
* HTML Reporter: Add a window.onerror handler. Makes uncaught errors actually fail the tests. [#134](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/134)
* HTML Reporter: Avoid internal exception if user extends Object.prototype object with non-standard properties.

Introduce the JUnitLogger addon, two new themes, and various bug fixes.

## Changelog

* Addons: New Gabe theme by Gabe Hendry. [#188](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/188)
* Addons: New NV theme by NV. [#62](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/62)
* Addons: New JUnitLogger addon.
* Core: Catch assertions running outside of `test()` context, make sure source is provided even for `ok()`. [#98](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/98)
* Core: Check for global object to find setTimeout in Node.js.
* Core: Clear all sessionStorage entries once all tests passed. Helps getting rid of items from renamed tests. [#101](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/101)
* Core: Fix sourceFromsStacktrace to get the right line in Firefox. Shift the 'error' line away in Chrome to get a match.
* Core: Generate more base markup, but allow the user to exclude that completely or choose their own. [#127](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/127)
* Core: In autorun mode, moduleDone is called without matching moduleStart. [#184](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/184)
* Core: Remove the testEnvironmentArg to `test()`. Most obscure, never used anywhere. `test()` is still heavily overloaded with argument shifting, this makes it a little more sane. [#172](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/172)
* Core: Replace deprecated same and equals aliases with placeholders that just throw errors, providing a hint at what to use instead. Rename test file to match that.
* Core: Serialize expected and actual values only when test fails to improve testing speed for passing tests. [#183](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/183)
* Core: Update sessionStorage support test to avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_EXCEPTION.
* HTML Reporter: Avoid `outerHTML` for Firefox < 11. Use cloneNode instead.
* HTML Reporter: Escape `document.title` before inserting into markup. [#127](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/127)
* HTML Reporter: Fix the fixture reset to not break if the element is not present on the page.
* HTML Reporter: Keep label and checkbox together.
* HTML Reporter: Set fixed CSS dimensions on `#qunit-fixture`. [#114](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/issues/114)
* HTML Reporter: Show exception stack when test failed.

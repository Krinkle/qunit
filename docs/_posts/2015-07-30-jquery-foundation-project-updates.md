From [jQuery Foundation Project Updates](https://blog.jquery.com/2015/07/30/jquery-foundation-project-updates/), blog.jquery.com:

> [The latest release, 1.18.0]({% post_url 2015-04-03-qunit-1-18-0 %}), made a lot of improvements to the HTML reporter, making it more efficient to debug failures. For example, a new diff algorithm makes it easier to spot the difference in failed expected/actual assertions.
>
> Weâ€™re currently working on the [js-reporters](https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/) project, which QUnit will implement, along with hopefully many other JavaScript testing frameworks and tools. The goal is to standardize an API with events and event data for test runners. A tool like Karma could then adopt a single interface instead of having to support each testing tool individually.

Set a global default timeout in milliseconds after which an async test will fail. This helps to detect async tests that are broken, and prevents a test run from hanging indefinitely.

Only async tests can timeout. An async test is any [QUnit.test](../QUnit/test.md) with an async function as callback, or that returns a Promise, or that calls [assert.async()](../assert/async.md).

The `testTimeout` config can be overridden via [assert.timeout()](../assert/timeout.md) to any lower or higher amount.

It is recommended to keep the global default at `3000` or higher (3 seconds), to avoid intermittent failures from unrelated delays that may periodically occur inside a browser or CI service.

## Introducing a default timeout

Prior to QUnit 3, there has not been a default timeout. This meant that a test hang silently for many seconds or minutes before diagnostic details are presented (e.g. after a CI job reaches the maximum run time).

QUnit 3.0 will change the default timeout from undefined (Infinity) to 3 seconds.

### Deprecated: No timeout set

Starting in QUnit 2.21, a deprecation warning will be logged if a test takes longer than 3 seconds, when there is no timeout set.

```
Test {name} took longer than 3000ms, but no timeout was set.
```

You can address this warning before upgrading to QUnit 3 as follows:

* **(Recommended)** Call [assert.timeout()](../assert/timeout.md) inside the slow test.

  ```js
  QUnit.test('example', function (assert) {
    assert.timeout(5000);
    // â€¦
  });
  ```

* Or, set `QUnit.config.testTimeout` once from an [HTML or bootstrap script](../config/index.md).

  ```js
  QUnit.config.testTimeout = 60000; // 1 minute
  ```

* Or, set `qunit_config_testtimeout` via [preconfig](../config/index.md) as environment variables (for Node.js), or as global variables for HTML/browser environments (before QUnit is loaded).

* Or, your test runner of choice may offer other ways to set configuration.

  For example, to set `testTimeout` via [karma-qunit](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit/#readme):

  ```js
  config.set({
    frameworks: ['qunit'],
    plugins: ['karma-qunit'],
    client: {
      qunit: {
        testTimeout: 5000
      }
    }
  });
  ```
